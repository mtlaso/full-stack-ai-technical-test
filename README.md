# AI-Enhanced E-commerce Analytics Platform

## Overview
Build a full-stack application that allows e-commerce merchants to gain AI-powered insights from their store data. The application will connect to Shopify via GraphQL, process and analyze the data using AI services, and present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Time Expectations
- Please document any shortcuts taken due to time constraints
- You have 1 week to complete this challenge

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (Next.js (React))
- Create a responsive dashboard with the corrsponding views for the choosen AI intergration
- Implement proper state management
- Create at least one data visualization component (chart, graph, etc.)
- Build a component that displays AI-generated insights

### Backend (Next.js backend or Node.js or Python)
- Create an API using either Next.js backend or Node.js or Python
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Fetching data from Shopify via GraphQL
  - Processing and storing data in databases
  - Generating insights using AI services
- Include proper error handling and logging

### Data Storage
- You can use either PostgreSQL (with Prisma) or MongoDB

### AI Integration
- Implement at least 1 of the following features using AWS services and corresponding dashboard views:
  - Product description generation/enhancement

   - Frontend codebase (Next.js/React)
   - Backend codebase (Next.js backend or Node.js or Python)
     - Make sure to include database schema definitions/migrations

2. **Documentation**:
   - Setup instructions
   - Architecture diagram
   - API documentation
   - Explanation of AI integration approaches
   - Any assumptions made during development

3. **Demo**:
   - Deployed application URL
   - Sample test data (if needed for demonstration)

## Evaluation Criteria
We will assess your submission based on:

- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
